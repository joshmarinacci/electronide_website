            <p class='lead'>Electron is a real editor.</p>
            <p> By using Ace, it hash line numbers, syntax highlighting, and proper keybindings.</p>

            <p>
                  It can auto-install many libaries and board definitions on the fly,
                  and can get new libaries as they are added to the repo, without updating Electron itself.
                  All definitions are contributed by the community to a separate repo. With a quick
                  <code>npm update</code> you'll get all of the latest boards and libraries.

            <h1>News</h1>
            <h3>0.2 released</h3>
            <p>I’m happy to announce Electron v0.2. We’ve done a ton of work to improve the
                compiler and library tools. The biggest news is Windows and Linux
                support. Also, you don’t need to pre-install the regular Arduino IDE anymore.
                Electron will auto-download it’s own copy of the required toolchain.  Here’s the
                details:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Initial Windows and Linux support!</li>
                <li> You don’t need to modify settings.js anymore. Electron will auto detect your Arduino/Sketchbook dir.</li>
                <li> You don’t need the regular Arduino IDE installed anymore. The appropriate toolchain will be auto-downloaded for you the first time you compile something.</li>
                <li> User installed libs work now. Note that user installed libs take a priority over libs installed by the IDE.</li>
                <li> the serial port will be automatically closed and reopened when you upload a sketch. If this crashes your computer please let me know. I might need to increase the timeouts.</li>
                <li> Preliminary support for auto-detecting which board you are using by the USB VID/PID. Special thanks to PixnBits for that.</li>
                <li> Set the serial port speed</li>
                <li> Sketch rename works now</li>
                <li> download progress is shown in the browser (partially)</li>
                <li> tons of under the hood fixes</li>
                <li> auto scroll the console</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The <code>arduino-data</code> project was also updated with new boards an libraries:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> New boards: TinyLily and Gamebuino</li>
                <li> More networking libs: CmdMessenger, OneWire, PS2Keyboard, SerialControl, SSoftware2Mobile, Webduino</li>
                <li> More specs on various boards</li>
                <li> The rest of the built in libraries: Ethernet, Firmata, GSM, LiquidCrystal, SD, SoftwareSerial, TFT, WiFi</li>
                <li> Support library sub-dependencies</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Thanks to contributors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Dan O’Donovan / Dan-Emutex</li>
                <li> Nick Oliver / PixnBits</li>

            <h3>v0.1 released</h3>
            <p>I'm happy to announce Electron v0.1. This release has a ton of fixes
                to the toolchain. It should support 3rd party libs properly, and
                has preliminary support for Linux. I've also made a bunch of
                small GUI tweaks and the first attempt at a serial console.</p>

            <p>Note that on Linux you should use the arduino-core package
                provided by your OS, and make sure that node --version returns something valid. You might have another program called node in it's place.
            </p>

            <p>For this release please test compiling all of your sketches to see where it breaks. Undoubtedly we will have more libraries and compiler fixes to add. File issues on the github project
            </p>

            <p>Special thanks to friends of the show Sean McCarthy, HippyJake, and Dean Iverson for their patches.</p>

            <h1>Install</h1>
            <p>While we are planning a downloadable app in the future, for now you must be comfortable
            with the command line. Electron is written in NodeJS and uses your webbrowser
            for the interface. While it <em>should</em> work on Windows and Linux, most testing
            has been Mac so far. <a href='#contribute'>(More testers are welcome)</a></p>

            <p>To test out Electron you must:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Install node with npm if you don't already have it.</li>
                <li>Check out the code: <code>git clone https://github.com/joshmarinacci/ElectronIDE</code></li>
                <li>Install all deps with <code>cd ElectronIDE; npm install</code></li>
                <li>Run <code>node electron</code></li>
                <li>open your browser to <code>http://localhost:54329/</code></li>
            </ul>

            <h4>A note on Linux</h4>
            <p>In theory Electron should just work on Linux since it's just JavaScript underneath.
                However, some users have reported that some Linux distros have an existing program
                called <code>node</code> that is actually an ancient packet radio program. Try
                running <code>node --version</code> to make sure you really have NodeJS 10.x and not some other
                program. Uninstall it if you do. NodeJS might also be run as <code>nodejs</code> instead of node.
            </p>

            <h1>Contribute</h1>

            <p>It's early days for Electron. We need your help. Our most urgent need is
                testing. Test every sketch you have. Test every board you have. If something
                doesn't compile, but does in the official IDE, then that's a bug. Let us
                know and we'll fix it right away.</p>
